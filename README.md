## üéØ Problem Statement

Brain tumor segmentation in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans is a critical first step for **diagnosis, treatment planning, surgical guidance, and monitoring disease progression**. However, manual segmentation by expert radiologists is laborious, time-consuming, and prone to inter-observer variability.

This project aims to automate this process by implementing and comparing **three distinct deep learning approaches** for segmenting tumors in 3D MRI volumes. The goal is to address key challenges including:

* Variable tumor shapes, sizes, and locations üé≤
* Significant class imbalance (tumors often occupy a small portion of the brain volume)‚öñÔ∏è
* Preserving 3D spatial context for accurate volumetric analysis üßä
* Demonstrating model performance using accessible synthetic data üí°

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Explanation

This repository provides a Jupyter Notebook implementation comparing three different deep learning architectures for 3D brain tumor segmentation:

1.  **U-Net (Baseline):** The classic encoder-decoder CNN architecture, renowned for its effectiveness in biomedical image segmentation due to skip connections that combine deep, semantic features with shallow, high-resolution features.
2.  **Attention U-Net:** An enhanced U-Net incorporating 'Attention Gates'. These gates learn to suppress irrelevant regions in input features while highlighting salient features useful for the specific task, improving focus on the tumor region.
3.  **Transformer-Enhanced Model:** A hybrid architecture leveraging the strengths of both CNNs and Transformers. A CNN encoder extracts local features, which are then processed by a Transformer block to capture long-range dependencies and global context before a final CNN decoder generates the segmentation map.

**Key Features ‚ú®:**

* Comparison of multiple advanced segmentation architectures (U-Net, Attention U-Net, Transformer Hybrid)
* Self-contained synthetic 3D MRI data generation (`128x128x128`) for easy experimentation
* Implementation of Attention mechanisms within the U-Net framework
* Integration of a basic Transformer block with a CNN backbone
* Comprehensive evaluation using standard segmentation metrics (Dice Score, Mean Intersection over Union - IoU) üìà
* Clear visualization of segmentation results and training progress üìä

**‚ö†Ô∏è Implementation Note:** While the project generates and processes 3D volumetric data, the current neural network implementations primarily utilize **2D convolutional layers (`Conv2D`, `MaxPooling2D`)** for simplicity and demonstration purposes. For optimal performance on real-world 3D MRI data, adapting these models to use their 3D counterparts (`Conv3D`, `MaxPooling3D`, etc.) is recommended as a next step.

## üíæ Dataset

This project uses **synthetically generated 3D MRI data** created programmatically within the Jupyter Notebook (`load_sample_data` function). This allows for immediate execution and experimentation without needing large external downloads.

* **Synthetic Data Characteristics:** 3D volumes (`128x128x128`), random noise background, simulated spherical tumors with higher intensity. The synthetic data aims to mimic some basic characteristics for testing the segmentation algorithms.

**For Real-World Application:**

A standard benchmark dataset for this task is the **BraTS (Brain Tumor Segmentation) Challenge dataset**.
* You can find versions of it hosted in various places, including as part of the [Medical Segmentation Decathlon](http://medicaldecathlon.com/) (Task 1: Brain Tumour).
* *Note: Access typically requires registration, and processing real BraTS data often involves additional steps like format conversion (e.g., using Nibabel) and specific preprocessing pipelines.*
